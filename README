Introduction of The Pixel Game:
	TODO

NOTE:
	1. There is some comment in the code with "TODO"
	2. Improve UI
	3. Add features => calculate target, timer counting down, maintain scores, etc...

What I've Done:
	1. Basic Bootstrapping Server
	2. Basic (Ugly) User Interface
	3. Basic Interaction Between Multiple Users

What I'm Going To Do:
	1. [Kinda Done] refactor the whole code -> current code can run, but it's really ugly...
	2. add "real" exit feature
	3. add my uncertainties in Issues

How To Run The Code For Fun:
	1. checkout all code from github
	2. make sure you have pyqt installed
	3. change the SERVER_HOST to your ip address in const.py
	4. in one console: python main.py B
		->This will run the bootstrapping server
	5. in another console: python main.py
		->This will run the game
	6. you can run multiple games and test the interaction between all players
	7. exit feature is not completely supportted yet. it only stop the program, but it will not send LEAVE msg to server or other players -> I'm writing this feature after next Monday~

Enjoy the little demo :D
